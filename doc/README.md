# Enable App Mesh for an ECS/Fargate Application using the AWS Console

> AWS just released new management console support for AWS App Mesh. Now customers can easily enable and gain the benefits of service mesh support for their microservice applications running on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate.
>
> This brief guide will demonstrate how to enable AWS App Mesh for a Fargate application. After enabling mesh integration, we'll do a canary release of a new version of a backend service before shifting all of our traffic over.

We will use the Color App for this demo.
